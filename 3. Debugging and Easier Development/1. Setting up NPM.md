To install packages that are not part of the Node core modules, we can use NPM (Node Package Manager). NPM allows us to install packages from outside of Node's core modules and write scripts that can spin up servers.

To start, we can execute the given command on the terminal. (Make sure that your terminal is open in the desired location.)
`$ npm init`

After setup, we can add scripts to the `package.json`. 
`"start":"node app.js"`
This will start our server whenever we type `npm start` in our terminal. For other scripts, you have to use `npm run` unless they have a special name like `start` or `install`.
For example : 
```js
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "node app.js",
    "start-server": "node app.js"
  }
```
To run the `start-server` script, we'll have to use `npm run start-server`

### Adding Dependencies to Project
To add external node modules that we'll only use in dev environment :-
```sh
npm install nodemon --save-dev
// To install package only for dev

npm install nodemon --save
// To install a package as a production dependency

npm install nodemon -g
// Will install the package on you local machine and not in the project
// However you'll still be able to use it in your project
```

Nodemon is a tool that helps you automatically restart your server every time you save changes to your project. If you haven't installed Nodemon globally and you run `nodemon app.js`, it will throw an error. However, you can define a script and then run that script whenever you want to start your server.

```json
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "nodemon app.js",
    "start-server": "node app.js"
  }
```
