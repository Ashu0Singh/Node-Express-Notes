There are three types of errors in programming:
1.  **Syntax Errors**: These are typos or missing semicolons that will be revealed when you run your code.
2.  **Runtime Errors**: These errors won't stop the execution of the program, but they might break the program in the middle of its execution.
3. **Logical Errors**: You won't notice these errors during runtime, but they will become apparent when you don't get the desired output, indicating an error in your logic. To catch these errors you can use the debugger which will help you identify the value of variables while the code is still executing 

## Logical Errors 
Runtime and syntax errors are easy to resolve as they are explicitly specified when encountered. However, this is not the case with logical errors, which can be more challenging to fix. To resolve them, we can use a debugger and set breakpoints to go through our code's logic and identify where we are going wrong.

### Debugger

Debugger is a powerful tool in VS Code that can help you identify and resolve logical errors in your code. Here's a guide on how to use debugger on VS Code:

1.  Open the file you want to debug and set a breakpoint by clicking on the line number where you want to pause your code execution. Alternatively, you can use the shortcut F9 to set a breakpoint.
2.  Open the Debug tab on the left sidebar or press Ctrl+Shift+D to open it.
3.  Click on the gear icon to open the launch configuration file. You can create a new one or edit an existing one.
4.  Set the "program" property to the path of the file you want to debug.
5.  You can also set the "args" property to pass arguments to your program.
6.  Select the environment you want to use, like Node.js or Chrome.
7.  Click on the green play button to start debugging.
8.  Your code will now execute until it reaches the breakpoint you set, and it will pause there. You can now inspect the variables and step through your code using the buttons on the debug toolbar.
9.  You can also use the debug console to run commands and evaluate expressions while debugging.
10.  Once you've identified and resolved the logical errors, you can stop the debugger and continue working on your code.

Debugger is a powerful tool that can help you save a lot of time and effort in identifying and resolving logical errors in your code. Make sure to use it to your advantage to write more efficient and error-free code.
