To serve dynamic content to our web pages, we use templating engines that have their own syntax to modify values while the page is being served. This helps us create dynamic web pages easily. Templating engines allow us to serve HTML files with dynamic content by passing values as parameters. These values can be modified by the server before the HTML file is served to the client. This makes the web page more dynamic and interactive.
Examples : 
1.  EJS - It uses HTML and plain JavaScript in your templates. It allows you to easily embed JavaScript code into your HTML, helping you create dynamic web pages easily.
2.  Pug (formerly known as Jade) - It is a high-performance template engine heavily influenced by Haml and implemented with JavaScript for Node.js and browsers. It uses minimal HTML and has its own custom template language.
3.  Handlebars - It uses normal HTML and its own custom template language, which is easy to learn and use. It has support for helpers, which are functions that can be used to perform operations on data being passed to the template.

## Pug
For most of this course we will be using pub so inorder. Let's install pug using 
`npm install pug --save`
To use Pug as our templating engine with Express, we need to do some configuration settings:

1.  Require `pug` in your file: `const pug = require('pug');`
2.  Set the view engine to Pug: `app.set('view engine', 'pug');`
3.  Set the path to the views directory where Pug files are located: `app.set('views', './views');`

After these configurations, you can use Pug syntax in your `.pug` files to create dynamic content.
```js
app.set('view engines','pug');
app.set('views', 'views')
```

Here is an example of HTML file conveted to pug 
#### `shop.pug`
```pug
doctype html
html(lang="en")
    head
        meta(charset="UTF-8")
        meta(http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible", content="IE=edge")
        meta(name="viewport", content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0")
        title #{docTitle}
        link(rel="stylesheet", href="/css/main.css")
        link(rel="stylesheet", href="/css/product.css")
    body 
        header.main-header
            nav.main-header__nav
                ul.main-header__item-list
                    li.main-header__item
                        a.active(href="/") Shop 
                    li.main-header__item
                        a(href="/admin/add-product") Add Product
        main
            if prods.length > 0
                div.grid
                    each product in prods
                        article.card.product-item
                            header.card__header
                                h1.product__title #{product.title}
                            div.card__image
                                img(src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/03/31/20/51/book-1296045_960_720.png" alt="A Book")
                            div.card__content
                                h2.product__price $19.99
                                p.product__description A very interesting book about so many even more interesting things!
                            div.card__actions
                                button.btn Add to Cart
            else
                h1 No Products
```
Here, as we can see, in order to iterate through a list of products, we can use a loop that we can create using the `each` statement. Here, `product` is the variable in which we store the values of each iteration and `prods` is the variable we are iterating over.
#### `shop.html`
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
    <title>Add Product</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/main.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/product.css">
</head>

<body>
    <header class="main-header">
        <nav class="main-header__nav">
            <ul class="main-header__item-list">
                <li class="main-header__item"><a class="active" href="/">Shop</a></li>
                <li class="main-header__item"><a href="/admin/add-product">Add Product</a></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
    </header>
</body>
</html>
```

To start rendering dynamic or static pug files, you need to use the `res.render()` method. This method takes two arguments: the name of the pug file (without the `.pug` extension) and an object containing data that you want to pass to the pug file. The object is optional and is only required if you want to pass data to the pug file. The `res.render()` method compiles the pug file and returns the HTML code that can be sent as a response to the client.

```js
router.get('/',(req,res,next) => {
    const products = admin.products;
    res.render('shop', {prods: products , docTitle: "Shops"})
	// console.log(admin.products);
    // res.sendFile(path.join(rootDir,"views","shop.html"))
})
```


## EJS
In EJS, dynamic content can be included using the syntax `<%= variableName %>` where `variableName` is the name of the variable that contains the value you want to display. For example, if you have a variable named `pageTitle` that contains the title of your webpage, you can display it in the HTML using the following code:

```ejs
<title><%= pageTitle %></title>
```
You can also add JavaScript code using the `<% %>` syntax. For example, if you want to loop through an array of products and display them on your webpage, you can use the following code:
```ejs
<ul>
	<% products.forEach(function(product) { %>
		<li><%= product.name %> - <%= product.price %></li>
	<% }); %>
</ul>`
```
