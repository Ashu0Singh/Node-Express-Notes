These are a way to represent data and the logic associated with it in a web application.
-   A model is like a blueprint or template for a specific type of data (e.g. user account, blog post, product)
-   The model defines the data structure and specifies operations (e.g. create, read, update, delete)
-   For example, a user account model might define the user's name, email, password and operations like create, read, update, delete
-   Models help maintain consistency and reliability in data accessed by the application
-   Models simplify the code by separating data logic from the application logic

In our application, we will create a class to establish the structure of our data, as well as provide several useful functions. One of these functions is responsible for writing the current object to a file, while another function is used to retrieve all the data from the file.
```js
const path = require("path");
const fs = require("fs");

const p = path.join(
  path.dirname(__dirname,".."),
  'data','product.json'
);

const getFileContent = (callBack) => {
  fs.readFile(
    p,(err,fileContent) => {
      if(err)
        callBack([]);
      callBack(JSON.parse(fileContent));
  })
}
class Product {
  constructor(title) {
    this.title = title;
  }
  save() {
    getFileContent((products) => {
      products.push(this);
      fs.writeFile(
        p,JSON.stringify(products),(err) => {
          console.log(err);
      })
    })
  }

  static fetchAll(sendRes) {
    getFileContent(sendRes);
  }
}

module.exports = Product;
```

This code defines a Product class in a Node.js web application that has methods to save and fetch products from a JSON file.

-   The code imports the Node.js path and file system modules using the require() method.
-   The code sets the path to the product.json file by joining the parent directory of the current directory with the 'data' folder and 'product.json' file name.
-   The code defines a getFileContent function that takes a callback as a parameter. This function reads the file at the path specified and if there's an error reading the file, it calls the callback function with an empty array. Otherwise, it calls the callback function with the parsed contents of the file.
-   The code defines a Product class that takes a title parameter in its constructor and sets it as a property of the class.
-   The class has a save method that reads the existing products from the file using the getFileContent function, appends the new product to the array of products, and writes the updated array to the product.json file using the writeFile() method.
-   The class also has a static fetchAll method that takes a callback function as a parameter and uses the getFileContent function to read all the products from the file and send them back to the client via the callback function.
-   Finally, the module.exports statement exports the Product class so that it can be used in other files.

In summary, this code defines a Product class with methods to save and fetch products from a JSON file using the Node.js file system module.
