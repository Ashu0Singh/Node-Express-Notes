Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that uses a different version of JavaScript than the one used in web browsers. It adds some features and lacks some capabilities compared to browser-based JavaScript. Node.js can run JavaScript on any machine or server, making it useful for running JavaScript outside of the browser.

Both Node.js and browsers use V8, a JavaScript engine built by Google and written in C++, to compile JavaScript code into machine code. Unlike browsers, Node.js allows you to work with the local file system.

### Example - 
Here we can the see the code to create and write "Hello for Node JS" to a file named "Hello.txt"
```js
const fs = require('fs');

fs.writeFileSync("Hello.txt" , "Hello for Node JS");
```

You can use Node.js for more than just writing server-side code, such as for utility scripts and build tools. For example, Node.js is commonly used for all the build processes when working with JavaScript frameworks like ReactJS or Vue.
