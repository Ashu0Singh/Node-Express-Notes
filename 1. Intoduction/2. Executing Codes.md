### 1. Execute files 
You can write your code in a file using a code editor, and then execute that file to get the output. This is what we usually do when creating real-time applications using Node.js. We can execute the file using the `node` command followed by the filename, and it will run the code inside the file and give us the output.

Example - writeHello.js
```js
const fs = require('fs');

fs.writeFileSync("Hello.txt" , "Hello for Node JS");
```

### 2. REPL
REPL stands for Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop. In simpler words, you can execute your code in a command line format. To execute code in this format, enter `node` in your terminal and hit enter. Now, you can start executing your JavaScript code in the REPL format.
```js
Welcome to Node.js v19.6.0.       
Type ".help" for more information.
> const fs = require('fs');
undefined
> fs.writeFileSync("Hello.txt" , "Hello for Node JS");
undefined
```
You won't be able to store your code in this environment and reuse it later. This makes it a great playground to practice new and various things
