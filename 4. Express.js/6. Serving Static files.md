To add external CSS files to our web application, we need to serve them publicly so that our application can access them whenever the HTML page is loaded. By default, none of the files in our application are exposed to the public. To serve our CSS files, we can create a folder called "public" and then add a sub-folder called "css" within it. We can then place all our CSS files in this "css" sub-folder.
```js
const express = require('express')
const path = require('path')
const rootDir = require("./util/path")

const bodyParser = require('body-parser')

const admin = require('./routes/admin.js')
const shop = require('./routes/shop.js')

const app = express();

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded());
app.use(express.static(path.join(rootDir,"public")))

app.use('/admin',admin);
app.use(shop)

app.use((req,res,next) => {
    res.status(404).sendFile(
	    path.join(rootDir,"views","pageNotFound.html")
	)
});

app.listen(3000);
```
