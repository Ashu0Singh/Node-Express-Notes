The `app.use([path,],callback [,callback...])` [function](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#app.use) can be used in multiple ways to define middleware for different paths. You can define specific middleware for a particular path, but you can also define a middleware that runs for all paths.

Here is an example of a middleware that will run for all the paths:
```js
app.use('/',(req,res,next) => {
	console.log("This always runs!");
	res.send("<h1>I am the Generic Middleware</h1>");
})
```

Here are some specific middleware for specific paths :-
```js
app.use('/some-product',(req,res,next) => {
	console.log("We're at the products pages.");
	res.send("<h1>Product List</h1>");
})
```

If you are defining generic and specific middlewares, then the order of the middlewares matters a lot because once a middleware is executed and the response has been sent, you cannot send another response or add anything on top of it.
