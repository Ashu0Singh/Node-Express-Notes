We'll use a form to send a request to the backend.

```js
app.use('/add-product',(req,res,next) => {
	req.send(`
		<html>
			<head>
				<title>Add Product</title>
			</head>
			<body>
				<form action='/product' method='POST'>
					<input type='text' name='title'>
					<button type='submit'> Add Product </button>
				</form>
			</body>
		</html>
	`);
})
```

To receive a request containing data, we need to set up a middleware that can handle it and log the value of the received data to the console. However, before we can use the data in our backend, we must parse it. To accomplish this, we can use another middleware called body-parser, which we will install as a production dependency.
`npm install body-parser --save`

```js
const http = require('http');
const express = require('express')
const bodyParser = require('body-parser')

const app = express();

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded());

app.use('/add-product',(req,res,next) => {
	res.send(`
        <html>
            <head>
                <title>Add Product</title>
            </head>
            <body>
                <form action='/product' method='POST'>
                    <input type='text' name='title'>
                    <button type='submit'> Add Product </button>
                </form>
            </body>
        </html>
	`);
})

app.use('/product',(req,res,next) => {
    console.log(req.body);
    res.redirect('/');
})

app.use('/',(req,res,next) => {
	console.log("This always runs!");
    res.send("<h1>I am the Generic Middleware</h1>");
})

app.listen(3000);
// const server = http.createServer(app);
// server.listen(3000);
```

To use `body-parser`, 
- We first need to import it. 
- Now can set up a generic middleware for all the routes that will parse the body of every request.
- `bodyParser.urlencoded()` is used for specific kinds of data. For files or JSON, we'll need to use different parsers, which we will see later.
- Finally, we can extract the data from the request and use it by accessing `req.body`.

> `res.redirect()` is a function that can be used to redirect, instead of manually setting the status code and location in the header.

To distinguish between `get` and `post` requests, we can utilize two functions: [`app.get()`](https://expressjs.com/en/5x/api.html#app.get.method) and [`app.post()`](https://expressjs.com/en/5x/api.html#app.post.method), which can be found in the Express documentation. These functions function similarly to `app.use()`, but they are only activated for specific types of requests, such as `get` or `post`. Since these functions require an exact path match, they will not render anything unless the path is explicitly specified, which is not the case with `app.use()`.
