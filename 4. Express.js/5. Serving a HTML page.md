We cannot rely on sending dummy HTML codes every time in order to create a website with full functionalities. To render HTML files on the webpages, we need to send HTML files as responses to the client-side.

## File system
```
2.RoutesInExpress
	- node_modules
	- routes
		- admin.js
		- shop.js
	- util
		- path.js
	- views
		- add-product.html
		- shop.js
	- app.js
	- package-lock.json
	- package.json
```

In order to serve a file we need to a node module that helps us create path.

```js
const express = require('express')
const path = require('path')

const router = express.Router();

router.get('/',(req,res,next) => {
	console.log("This always runs!");
    res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname,"..","views","shop.html"))
})

module.exports = router;
```

-   `res.sendFile()` is a method used to send a file as a response to a request.
-   `path.join()` is a method used to create a path by joining path segments together.
-   `__dirname` is a global variable that gives us the absolute path of the directory that contains the currently executing file.
-   `..` is a relative path used to move one level higher in the directory hierarchy.

## Additional utility

In order to provide the absolute address of the root folder to every file, we can create a utility function. This function can be imported in any file and used to get the absolute path of the root folder. This makes it easy to access any file or directory in the project, without worrying about the relative path.

#### `path.js`
```js
const path = require('path');

module.exports = path.dirname(__dirname, "..")
```

In order to use it, we can import it directly from the folder, store it in a constant, and then use it wherever needed.

```js
const express = require('express')
const path = require('path')
const rootDir = require('../util/path')

const router = express.Router();

router.get('/',(req,res,next) => {
	console.log("This always runs!");
    res.sendFile(path.join(rootDir,"views","shop.html"))
})

module.exports = router;
```
