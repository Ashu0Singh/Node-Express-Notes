The flow chart above demonstrates how the web works from the client-side to the server-side.

1.  You type a URL in your browser.
2.  The browser reaches out to a Domain Name Server (DNS), which provides it with the IP address of the server. This process is called a Domain Lookup.
3.  Now, the browser sends a request to the given IP address that it received from the DNS, requesting data or authentication, etc.
4.  This is where your code comes into play. You write the code that runs on the server and responds to requests that it receives from the client-side. This code could be written in any programming language such as Node.js, PHP, or ASP.NET, etc.
5.  Here, you can do anything with the request, such as connecting to a database to fetch some data.
6.  After performing the business logic on the request, you respond with a response, which could be anything like JSON, HTML, or XML.
7.  After receiving the response, the client-side can process it.

These request and response transmissions are done through protocols like HTTP and HTTPS, which are standard ways of communicating to correctly handle our requests and send back a response that the browser can work with.
